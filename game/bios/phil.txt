"Seals and bonds!"

Phil loves tape. When he was young, he always asked for different kinds of tape to play with. He would gather random objects around his house to stick together. He always wanted to make a super tape that could hold anything together. With his newest invention, he has obtained the power to seal and bond almost anything.
