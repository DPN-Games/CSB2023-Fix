"Have a free pencil!"

You gotta wonder how this man lives his life when he's not at pencilcon. Maybe he has a pencil-shaped house? Maybe everything he owns is pencil-themed?
Maybe he's just a regular person, like you and me. He has a serious dedication to pencils though, and hates it when you bring up pens.
