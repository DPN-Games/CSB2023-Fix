"Look at me!"

The popular Twitch Streamer Jerma985, also known as Jermey Elbertson, didn't just move to Vegas because he loved gambling. No no, he wanted to make his OWN casino.
Jerma went out of his way this time to make the casino from his Casino Inc. livestream. People still think Jerma is doing this for the bit, but he still needs to pay off around 2 billion dollars.
