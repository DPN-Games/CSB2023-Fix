"I'm literally a hacker, guys! uwu"

The master hacker and technician himself, Arceus has a lot up his sleeve. He could do anything he wanted, if he could only be arsed. Some say he's got godlike powers, but others say he's way too lazy. Either way, he's happy to help CS out of the horrible mess that he's gotten himself into this time.
