"I'm literally a hacker, guys! uwu"

The master hacker and technician himself, Arceus has a lot up his sleeve. He could do anything he wants to do if he can be arsed. Some say he's got godlike powers, and others say he's way too lazy. Either way, he's glad to help CS out of the horrible mess that he's gotten himself into.
