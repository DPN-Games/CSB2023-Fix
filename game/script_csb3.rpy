    taran "Nah, don't worry about it."
    taran "Even if something dumb happens, he usually never gets mad at us for doing silly things like that."
    taran "Besides, he plays practical jokes on us half the time, so even if the video was dumb, I doubt he would be mad at all."
    cs "Well if you say so, I guess it's fine."

    cs "I got it! I know exactly what to do!"
    cs "If Taran really does mean what he says about Linus, then I'm sure he'll love this!"
    cs "I'm gonna turn this video into a YTP!"
    cs "It will be perfect! No one will expect it because they probably don't even know what I even did with my life for the past 13 years!"
    cs "As always, I should make sure it's as good as possible so at least Linus will enjoy it, along with his fans."
    cs "But I also don't have much time before Linus comes back and notices, so I need to hurry!"
    cs "Welp, time to get to work!"
