    linus "Actually, this is our worst setup, you'll get upgraded after you've been here a while."
    cs "Holy shit, really? This is way better than any setup I've seen, let alone had."
    linus "You must've had really bad setups then, this only has 2080s, everyone else has 2080 TIs or GTX Titans."

    cs "Dammit Taran, you can edit your own macro fetish content."
    cs "I guess I'll edit the livestreaming one."

    linus "Hey CS, how's the new video coming along?"
    cs "It's going well, I have the background all done and I'm working on adding graphics and fixing audio."
    linus "Wow! You're a fast worker, you'll get off of those old 2080s in no time."
    cs "Thanks Linus."
    linus "Speaking of live streaming, we need a new PC for the WAN Show, can you go and buy parts for one?"
