## KNOWN BUGS
### VISUAL
* The intro cutscene has a minor visual error
* Bad Ending screen has a green haze
* The ||Archival|| Ending is missing multiple backgrounds and transitions
### GAMEPLAY
* Sweden is currently not accessible
* ||RPG game still needs a decent amount of balancing work. Please report any cheeses you find or impossible-to-win scenarios (softlocks.)||
### VIDEO
* An ending video (||"Where Are They Now?"||) still has beta character sprites in it

### BUGS WE CAN NOT FIX
* When in Windowed mode, the Windowed mode option is not highlighted in the settings menu
* Occasionally, when in fullscreen, your cursor will be invisible. This might be a Windows bug. Restarting the game seems to fix it.
* Scrolling back during the ||RPG fights|| causes that sequence to restart entirely. This is because of how Ren'Py deals with these custom interactive elements.
* Ed with phone sprite isn't great but it's shown once in the game and is kinda funny
