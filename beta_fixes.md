## KNOWN BUGS
### VISUAL

* Luigi's sprites are very crunchy
* CSBI footage is missing as ||evidence||
* The ||Archival|| Ending is missing multiple backgrounds and transitions
* Customer does not appear in MCDs

### GAMEPLAY
* Sweden is currently not accessible
* A menu option is missing in Michigan

* ||RPG game still needs a decent amount of balancing work. Please report any cheeses you find or impossible-to-win scenarios (softlocks.)||
### AUDIO

### VIDEO

### BUGS WE CAN NOT FIX
* When in Windowed mode, the Windowed mode option is not highlighted in the settings menu
* Occasionally, when in fullscreen, your cursor will be invisible. This might be a Windows bug. Restarting the game seems to fix it.
* Scrolling back during the ||RPG fights|| causes that sequence to restart entirely. This is because of how Ren'Py deals with these custom interactive elements.
* Ed with phone sprite isn't great but it's shown once in the game and is kinda funny
